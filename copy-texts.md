## VISION SECTION

### Section Title
```
Building the Future of Humanoid Manipulation
```

### Three Pillars

1. **Build the world's leading humanoid hand**
2. **Set the global standard for industrial-grade humanoid manipulation**
3. **Make humanoid robots a real productivity driver in global industry**

---

## PHYSICAL AI SECTION

### Section Label
```
Core Technology
```

### Section Title
```
Powered by Physical AI
```

### Section Subtitle
```
From simulation to reality – our hands don't just move, they learn.
```

### Column 1: The Problem
**Title:** The Limitation of Traditional Robotics

**Text:**
```
For decades, industrial robots have followed rigid scripts. Every movement pre-programmed. Every task hardcoded. Change the object, change the environment – and the system fails.
```

**Highlight Quote:**
```
"Physical AI isn't a feature – it's the foundation of everything we build."
```

### Column 2: The Solution
**Title:** Our Approach: Physical Intelligence

**Text:**
```
SHR hands are different. Using Physical AI – the convergence of embodied learning, real-time simulation, and adaptive control – our systems develop intuitive manipulation skills that transfer from virtual training to real-world execution.

This means hands that adapt, generalize, and improve with every interaction.
```

---

### Three Pillars

#### Pillar 1: Sim-to-Real Transfer
```
We train in NVIDIA Omniverse and MuJoCo – millions of grasp variations, edge cases, and failure modes – before a single physical test. When our hands enter the real world, they've already mastered thousands of scenarios.
```

#### Pillar 2: Continuous Learning in Robotic Gyms
```
Our 15 global Robotic Gyms aren't showrooms – they're training grounds. Every interaction generates data. Every deployment improves the model. Physical AI that gets smarter with every grasp.
```

#### Pillar 3: Generalization, Not Programming
```
Traditional automation requires reprogramming for every new task. Our hands generalize: train once on manipulation primitives, deploy across industries – from automotive assembly to electronics handling.
```

---

### Technical Capabilities

| Capability | Value |
|------------|-------|
| Degrees of Freedom | Up to 20 DOF for human-like dexterity |
| Tactile Feedback | Integrated sensing for force-adaptive grasping |
| Training Infrastructure | 15 Robotic Gyms generating real-world data |
| Simulation Stack | NVIDIA Omniverse + MuJoCo integration |
| Deployment Speed | From sim-trained model to production in weeks |

---

### Closing Quote
```
Physical AI isn't a feature – it's the foundation. Every hand we build, every algorithm we train, every deployment we execute moves us closer to a world where humanoid robots aren't tools, but intelligent collaborators in every industry.
```

## RECRUITING SECTION

### Section Title
```
Join the Physical AI Revolution
```

### Section Subtitle
```
We're not hiring employees. We're assembling founders.
```

### Opening Statement

**Paragraph 1:**
```
Every day, industries lose billions to tasks that humans shouldn't do – repetitive, dangerous, inefficient. Traditional automation can't solve this. It's too rigid, too limited, too slow to adapt.
```

**Paragraph 2:**
```
We're building the solution: humanoid hands powered by Physical AI that learn, adapt, and scale across every industry on the planet. This isn't incremental improvement. This is a new category.
```

**Paragraph 3:**
```
And we need the people who will define it.
```
